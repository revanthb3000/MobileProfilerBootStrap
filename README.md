MobileProfilerBootStrap
================

This is a part of my BTP. This is the BootStrap that is used as the central hub in the network for devices to interact with.

#### Instructions to set up the project:
* Download the project template folder from http://goo.gl/iJ34fV
* Extract the contents of the archive. The extracted folder will serve as your project folder.
* Do a git init and set up your git remote in that folder. 
* Use a git pull to get the code.
* Now, copy the file 'repositoryBase.db', present in the 'BaseDB' folder, into the main folder. Rename the file as 'repository.db'
* To work with this project, just open Eclipse and import this folder as a project.
